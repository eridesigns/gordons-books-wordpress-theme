###Gordons Books

Simple flat WordPress theme designed to sell books online.

I started this theme as a branch for another theme called 'Bronte' but then I had diffrent ideas on how I wanted this theme to look so I changed the name to Gordons. You might see here and there PHP prefixes bronte_ , don't worry about it, is going to be updated in the next release. It does not affect the functionality at all. 



####This is version 1, first release.

In the version 1, I just wanted to create the foundations for the theme and they are already there. 

These are a few features that I would like to add in the coming versions:

- Book column options
- More layouts for the homepage
- Integrate a Paypal shopping cart
